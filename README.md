# GamepadController

Simple utility program to control my Windows PC with a xbox controller (from a comfortable couch). Supports multiple gamepads at once. Gamepad has to request control making the current main controller lose the control.

Keymaps:
 - A for left mouse click
 - B for right mouse click
 - Left stick to move
 - View Button to let go of the mouse controls

Patterns:
 - hold [RB,LB,Left stick button, Right stick button] to take control

Future features:
